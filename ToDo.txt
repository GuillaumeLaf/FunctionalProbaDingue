To Do or Ideas : 

1) Add specific type for Hyperparameters (?)
	answer : no, hyperparameters must all be included in 'DGP'.
2) Bayes hyperparameter tuning vs GridSearch vs PSO

3) (Multistep) predictions and prediction standard errors. 

4) Create a monad which saves the current state, does the computation and then reinit the state with the saved one ("state forgetting")

5) Create a monad which modifiy the current state and return the result of the argument monad (instead of 'unit').

6) GPU programming : https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp




Potential Refactoring : 

1) Separate the "data" from the 'Model'
	-> 'N', 'T', 'Ts', 'Innovations' are considered as data -> the only relevant one is 'Ts' since the other can be derived from it.
	-> Everything related to 'DGP', 'Graphs' (gradient, updaterule, ...) are considered as the real 'Model'.

	=> This would makes model selection easier by passing the desired 'TS' object (e.g. splitted 'TS') to the data for isolated fitting.
	=> 'Model' type would then be only responsible to hold the inner functioning of the true model. 

	done.

2) Possible inlining of functions
	-> makes code faster

3) FsharpPlus Applicative Generic Math operators e.g. .+. which is equivalent to (+) <!> _ <*> _
