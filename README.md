# About The Project
This Project constitutes my first real attempt at making a viable algorithmic trading system. I am currently in my last year of studies in Econometric at the UCLouvain (Louvain-la-Neuve). I believe that clear understanding of models and system is key to be trading profitably in the long run. Consequently, I implement my trading system using well-known and studied econometric models. This project is also the time to learn new concepts and apply them empirically. I originally wanted to create a brand new model to understand the markets but I soon realized that all my "findings" were already well understood and completely generalized. For instance, I was interested in creating a adaptative model based on dummy variables which would create non-linearities in the parameters but I remember that "Markov-switching models" were a thing... This project will thus implement a majority of those well-crafted models using various techniques.

## Major Techniques
